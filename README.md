# Matplotlib tutorial

This is a set of Matplotlib examples for self-learning. Examples are grouped in 4 modules: 

* Introduction - plotting sine and cosine with basic figure styling: plot colors, axis
* Plots Features - presents more detailed concepts working with plot lines, axis limits, titles, legends, annotations etc,
* Subplots - presents how to generate many plots in one figure side by side, explain how to structure the layout and a grid
* Other plots types - presents the other types of plots: scatter plot, bar plot, contour plot, 3d plots etc

This introduction to matplotlib is based on tutorial by Nicolas Rougier, Mike Muller and Gael Varoquaux [http://www.scipy-lectures.org/intro/matplotlib/matplotlib.html](http://www.scipy-lectures.org/intro/matplotlib/matplotlib.html)
